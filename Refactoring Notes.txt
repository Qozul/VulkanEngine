TODO:
 - Material.h input validation
 - Correct size buffers for each frame

Possible future stuff:
 - release material reference tracking
 - vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect
 - Scene graph, adding and removing a "draw" bool, then when traversing the scene graph every frame, also perform some simple
	culling and mark an object as draw or not.
 	 - Add a special SceneNode (derived) which is a SceneNodeGroup, and this marks more than a simple parent-child, but marks that they are the same "object"
	   and when one of these fails their test, the whole branch is discarded.
 	 - If moving towards an indirect rendering model, when the scene graph is traversed, the commands could be constructed
	 - If using sparse residency, could commit/uncommit textures based on scene graph traversal

 - Terrain: Change to be a single grid with uniform buffer of x,z offsets, set up draw elements command each frame with the current amount of instances
	    which offset themselves in the vshader, and tesselate, use offsets for uv coords.
